# MortgageDiscriminationandSolar
 To help combat racial discrimination, I decided to use my data science skillset to help contribute to the discussions and conduct a research project on identifying racial bias in conventional mortgages and its relation to Solar PV installations as part of the Data Good student club. Specifically, the theory I wanted to test was the idea that in some Metro Areas, Racial discrimination in Conventional Mortgages has resulted in minority groups obtaining an unfairly high monthly payment for their loans compared to whites. Metro Areas with this racial bias will have a wider solar installation gap between minorities and whites than MSAs (Metropolitan Statistical Area) without bias even when accounting for differences in homeownership to renter ratios. To test this hypothesis, I used the 2018 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, the 2018 Q1 Fannie Mae Single Family Performance Data, ACS 2018 5-year data, and Stanfordâ€™s Deep Solar data which is updated as of 2018.
